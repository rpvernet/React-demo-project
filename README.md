# React demo project

Small React project for portfolio purpose. It's a small blogging platform. I have started converting the code to TypeScript. So far, it's only the components that have been done, but I'll convert it completly soon. 

A deployed version is available here : https://renaud-v-react-demo.herokuapp.com/
